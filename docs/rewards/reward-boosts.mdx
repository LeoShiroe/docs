## Overview
In addition to the **Base Rewards**, a device already gets for contributing to weather data during the regular daily distribution. Learn more about the daily rewards [Reward Mechanism (RM) ](/reward-mechanism).

**Reward Boosts** rewards devices with extra $WXM tokens for meeting specific criteria. 

So far the following **Reward Boosts** are implemented:

### Beta Rewards

According to the [Token Allocation table](https://weatherxm.network/docs/wxm-token.html#token-allocation) 3M $WXM are reserved to reward stations that participated to the network before the Token Launch Day ("Beta period").

Beta rewards distribution will last 425 days, with Day 1 being the Token Launch day.

Calculation:

The following calculations will take place for each station, the day before the Token Launch:

`RewardableBetaHours[s]`.
This is the total number of hours the station provided valid data during the Beta period.
A rewardable hour is an hour during which the station sent at least one valid weather data point.

`StationBetaRewards[s] = 3000000 * RewardableBetaHours[s]/Sum(RewardableBetaHours of all stations)`
This is the percentage of the 3m tokens that correspond to the rewardable hours the station provided.
`DailyBetaRewards[s] = StationBetaRewards[s]/365`

This is the beta rewards allocated daily to this station.


:::info
Stations must have a wallet defined to be part of the Beta Rewards allocation.

:::note
The Beta Rewards allocation is managed by the [WeatherXM Network](https://weatherxm.network).

### Cell Boost

Cell Boost is a mechanism that can be used to incentivize waether stations to be deployed on a specific cell. 


#### Examples of reward programs that may be implemented using **Rewards Boost**, in the near future are:


- As part of the &&Beta Rewards** program, the first 100 devices that join the network will receive tokens.
- Backfill of rewards that were not allocated to certain devices due to malfunctions in the Quality of Data (QoD) mechanism](/project/quality-of-data) or [Proof of Location (PoL) mechanism](/project/proof-of-location).
- Public Goods Funding (PGF) for devices that are deployed and contribute to the network in a humanitarian way, such as providing data in an underserved area or during a specific time. 
- Devices that contribute to the network during a specific event, such as a natural disaster, will receive a boost in rewards.
- Demand driven rewards, a third party who needs data from specific cells.

:::tip
The **Rewards Boost** is a mechanism that can be used to incentivize specific behavior from devices. It is a flexible mechanism that can be used to incentivize any behavior that is beneficial to the network.
