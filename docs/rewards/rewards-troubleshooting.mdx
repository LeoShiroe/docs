A guide to interpreting mobile app error messages, understanding their meanings, and taking appropriate actions to resolve them.

### No wallet

It seems that you haven't connected a wallet to your account yet. Please note that in order to receive rewards, you must connect a wallet address. Here's what you need to do:

1. First, learn how to add or edit a wallet address [How to add/edit a wallet address](/wallet/add-edit-wallet-address#how-to-create-wallet-on-metamask) .
2. Then, follow the instructions for [How to join Arbitrum Sepolia and see your tokens](/wallet/how-to-join-arbitrum-and-see-your-tokens#add-arbitrum-sepolia-network-to-metamask).

Once you've completed these steps, you'll be all set to claim your rewards. Check back tomorrow and see "How to Claim Rewards" for further guidance.

### No Station Data 

It seems that your station sent no data at all. 
That either means that your station was offline or not connected to the network. 

Here's what you need to do:

**For WS-1000 (wifi or M5 version)**

1. Check if the station's battery level is low through mobile app settings
If the battery is low, the connection between your station and the M5 gateway will be unstable, resulting in data loss. 
2. Follow the Troubleshooting guide here [No WiFi connection](/wifi-m5-bundle/m5-troubleshooting#no-wifi--connection).
3. Check that your station connection (RF) to the gateway is stable by following the guide [here](/wifi-m5-bundle/m5-troubleshooting#weather-station-not-reporting-data-to-m5-miner-there-are-dashes----on-the-display-console).
4. Also read through the guide to add the included external antenna [here](/wifi-m5-bundle/m5-troubleshooting#my-station-does-not-connect-to-the-m5-miner). 

**For WS-2000 (Helium version)**

1. Check if the station's battery level is low through mobile app settings
2. Check for [Helium coverage](/helium-troubleshooting#how-to-see-if-there-is-helium-coverage-in-your-area)

### Sensor Problems

Weather data packets failed to pass our quality checks. We evaluate all data packets sent by our weather stations by our QoD (Quality of Data) algorithm. You can read more [here](https://docs.weatherxm.com/project/quality-of-data).
There are several reasons that you may experience this error, which includes:

- Out-of-bounds data
- Spikes on data 
- Constant Values
- Frozen sensor

Check that your station is deployed correctly [station deployment](/deployment-examples), and observe it for  a couple of days before contacting our support team. If you still receive the error, you are advise to contact our support team for more guidance.

### Weather Data Gaps

Weather data packets failed to pass our quality checks. We evaluate all data packets sent by our weather stations by our QoD (Quality of Data) algorithm. You can read more [here](https://docs.weatherxm.com/project/quality-of-data).

### Bad Station Deployment

It seems like your station needs some improvement on how and where is deployed. 
Check our [Deployment Examples](/deployment-examples) and [Best Practices](/wxm-devices/wifi-m5-bundle/install-weather-station#best-practices-for-proper-station-installation) for some inspiration on how and where you should install your weather station.

It is mandatory to have a proper installation to receive the maximum amount of rewards.
Our QoD algorithm runs every day, and your data is being evaluated Read more [here](/project/quality-of-data).

### No location Data

Please make sure to check the troubleshooting guides depending on your weather station before contacting our [support team](https://support.weatherxm.com). 

**For WS-1000 (wifi or M5 version)**

1. [No Locationon](/wifi-m5-bundle/m5-troubleshooting#no-location-gps-data-arrow-icon-is-red)
2. [No GPS signal](/wxm-devices/wifi-m5-bundle/m5-connect-and-claim#place-m5-near-a-window-for-better-gps-signal)

**For WS-2000 (Helium version)**

1. [No location](/helium-bundle/helium-troubleshooting#no-location-gps-data)
2. [Installing Instructions](/wxm-devices/helium-bundle/helium-install-weather-station)

### Location Not Verified
It seems that your location is different from the one you set during your station claim.
Please verify your location through the mobile app (Station details -> Settings -> Edit Location)
In detail  the [Proof of Location (PoL) mechanism](/project/proof-of-location) flaged your weather station because the location reported by its GPS receiver(s) is different than the location you declared during the setup and claiming of the station. 

This happens because either you moved the station from its initial installation site, or you declared a wrong location during the onboarding of the station on your mobile app.
This incurs a "relocation penalty," meaning your station will be exempt from reward distribution until you verify the location or relocate the weather station (move to another cell) 

:::note
During the beta phase and while the project is still on a test-net, the Proof of Location penalty imposed to devices that went through a relocation is reduced to 2 days for testing purposes

<hr/>

### User Relocation Penalty

It seems like you used the relocation feature or you edited the location of your weather station through the app.
Please wait 7 days and your Weather station will start to gain rewards again.
