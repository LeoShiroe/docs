### Maintenance of the outdoor sensor

The maintenance of the outdoor sensor is an important process, which should be conducted meticulously over the suggested periods of time.
This process includes the cleansing of certain parts of the outdoor unit and the checking of the battery level.
The maintenance process is summarized in the following steps:

  #### Instructions for opening the rain gauge

1. Clean the rain gauge at least once every 3 months.

    - Rotate the rain collector by turning it 30 anti-clockwise.

    - Gently remove the rain collector.

    - Clean and remove any debris or insects.

    - Install the collector when it is clean and fully dried.

2. Clean the solar panel at least every 3 months with a damp cloth.
3. Remove any dirt, debris and insects from the thermo-hygro sensor every 12 months. It might be needed to open the radiation shield using a screwdriver and fully clean the thermo-hygro sensor in case there is too much debris on it.

    - Remove the 2 screws at the bottom of the radiation shield.

    - Gently pull out the shield.

    - Carefully remove any dirt or insects in the sensor.

    - Clean the shiled with water to remove any dirt or insects. **Do not let the sensors inside get wet.**
    
    - Install all the parts back when they are clean and fully dried.

4. Clean the UV sensor and calibration

    - For precision UV measurement, gentle clean the UV sensor cover lens with damp micro-fiber cloth.

    - Over time, the UV sensor will naturally degrade. The UV sensor can be calibrated with a utility grade UV meter.
