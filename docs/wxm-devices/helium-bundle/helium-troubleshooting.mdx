### The updating process lasts forever

If the process hangs and does not proceed or if pairing fails try a factory reset.
To reset, hold down the middle button on the bottom of the weather station, count to ~10 and release. The LED will start flashing very quickly as an indication that the factory reset has succeeded and then the station will restart reset.

Restart your station, pairing is only allowed in the first 5 minutes after the station is started. After 5 minutes the station refuses pairing. If the problem persists do a factory reset and try again.

Make sure the device has started. Remove and reinsert one of the batteries, the light at the bottom of the station will flash a few times. If it continues to go undetected, approach the station. The range of the station is around 10m with few obstacles.
