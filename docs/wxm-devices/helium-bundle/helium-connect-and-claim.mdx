#### Select the Location that you'll Install your Station

Allow access to you location so that the WXM app knows where you are planning to install your WeatherXM Station. Doing so, will make it easier to complete this step.

Alternatively, you can find the location manually using the map.

Once you've found the right location, tap on the checkbox to acknowledge the correctness of the installation location, and then tap on "confirm and proceed" button.

:::note
We do not track you, nor do we collect any data about your location.

:::caution
Make sure you define the location that you will install your station as precise as possible, as this will play it'a part on the quality of data you will share with the network, and thus your overall WXM rewards.

Once you've found the right frequency, tap on the checkbox to acknowledge the correctness of the installation , and then tap on "Set & Claim" button.
That's it! You;ve now claimed your new WeatherXM Station, and you'll be able to see it's data on your WeatherXM apps!

All you need to do now, is to update your weather station to the latest firmware version. To do so, please follow the instructions in the chapter ["Update Firmware"](/wxm-devices/helium-bundle/helium-update-firmware/). 

:::caution
You hereby acknowledge that the frequency selected above is the correct on for the country you’ve installed and will opearate this station.
