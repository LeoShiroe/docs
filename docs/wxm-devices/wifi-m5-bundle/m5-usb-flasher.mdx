<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>If you are currently using a WXM-M5 with firmware version 0.3.11, it's essential to update your device using the Flasher Tool. This version is considered obsolete and cannot receive updates through the "Over The Air" (OTA) method anymore due to significant differences in the underlying operating system. To ensure your WXM-M5 continues to operate efficiently and receive rewards, you must perform a full firmware flash using a USB cable.</p>
<p>This guide will walk you through the step-by-step process of updating your WXM-M5 to the latest firmware version, ensuring you stay up to date with the latest features, security enhancements and continue to receive rewards.</p>

:::tip
To check the version of your WXM-M5, swipe to the left-most screen (about). If your version is newer than 0.3.11 you do not need to proceed with this update as your device will receive updates automatically.
:::

:::warning
Support for M5 devices running v0.3.11 will be discontinued from November 2023 and they will cease to receive rewards shortly thereafter.

  <div>
    <p>In the Flasher Tool under "serial port", you can see all the devices connected to the virtual serial ports on your computer. Confirm that the port of your M5 is selected. Usually the device with the largest suffix number is the one that was connected more recently.</p>

<h2 id="troubleshooting">Troubleshooting</h2>
<h3>Windows</h3>
<p>The flasher tool runs on Windows 10/11. Windows 7 is not supported.</p>
<p>When you run the tool, you will be greeted by the "Windows prevented an unrecognized application from running.". This is because the binary is not signed. Click More Info > Run Anyway to proceed.</p>
<h3>Linux</h3>
<p>Tested only on Debian based distributions.</p>
<p>If you encounter issues during the flashing process, follow these steps:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>If flashing fails immediately after pressing the "update" button, it may be due to insufficient privileges to access the serial port. In Debian-based distributions, run the following command to add your user to the appropriate group:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-bash">sudo adduser $USER dialout
</code></pre>
<p>After running this command, log out and then log back in, and retry the update process. If the issue persists, try running the Flasher Tool with sudo:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-bash">sudo /opt/wxm_m5_flasher/run.sh
</code></pre>
</li>
</ol>
<p>If you have any further questions or encounter any issues during the update process, don't hesitate to reach out to our support team for assistance. We are here to help you keep your M5 up to date and running smoothly.
