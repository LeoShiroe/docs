<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>If you are currently using an M5 Miner with firmware version 0.3.11, it's essential to update your device using the Flasher Tool. This version is considered obsolete and cannot receive updates through the "Over The Air" (OTA) method due to significant differences in the underlying operating system. To ensure your M5 Miner continues to operate efficiently and receive rewards, you must perform a full firmware flash using a USB cable.</p>
<p>This guide will walk you through the step-by-step process of updating your M5 Miner to the latest firmware version, ensuring you stay up to date with the latest features, security enhancements and continue to receive rewards.</p>

<p>If you encounter issues during the flashing process, follow these steps:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>If flashing fails immediately after pressing the "update" button, it may be due to insufficient privileges to access the serial port. In Debian-based distributions, run the following command:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-bash">sudo adduser $USER dialout
</code></pre>
<p>After running this command, log out and then log back in, and retry the update process. If the issue persists, try running the Flasher Tool with sudo:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-bash">sudo /opt/wxm_m5_flasher/run.sh
</code></pre>
</li>
<li><p>If you continue to experience problems with the update, please contact our support team for assistance. Be sure to include the contents of your log file for further analysis. To access the log file, click "Log" in the top right corner of the Flasher Tool window.</p>
</li>
</ol>
