If you don’t have a wallet, [create one](/wallet/add-edit-wallet-address#how-to-create-wallet-on-metamask) which is recommended if you want to see test tokens.

### Add Arbitrum Network to Metamask

Adding Arbitrum Network support to MetaMask is a mandatory step in order to add the WXM token, view activity, and make transactions.
Make sure you follow our step-by-step guide below for adding the Arbitrum Network to MetaMask.

We will provide guidance for both Arbitum Mainnet and Testnet (also called Sepolia Testnet) but
as we are currently in testnet, **you need to add the Testnet network.**

There are two ways to do it:

1. [Using Arbiscan](/wallet/how-to-join-on-testnet-and-see-your-tokens#using-polygonscan) **(Only for Desktop with MetaMask browser extension already installed)**
1. [Add the Arbitrum network manually](/wallet/how-to-join-on-testnet-and-see-your-tokens#add-the-polygon-network-manually)

### Using Arbiscan

:::note
Please make sure you have already installed **[MetaMask](https://metamask.io/)**!

**This solution works only on desktop with the MetaMask browser extension already installed.**
